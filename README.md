# Real Estate Management System (REMS)

The **Real Estate Management System (REMS)** is an in-progress software engineering project designed to streamline and automate real estate operations for large-scale commercial property developers.  
This system supports leasing agents, administrative staff, and tenants by providing tools for inventory management, appointment scheduling, rental agreements, invoicing, and maintenance requests.

> 🚧 **Project Status:**  
> REMS is currently under active development.  
> Code implementation is coming soon — documentation and system design are being completed first.
